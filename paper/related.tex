Chapter 4 of the classic textbook by Peyton Jones~\cite{spj_1987}
defines lambda abstractions with patterns $\lambda p.E$ together with an
alternative operator and a FAIL expression; the semantics for
matching is denotational and serves as the basis for defining
the correctness of compilation into case expressions.

Kahl defines a pattern matching calculus and proved
its confluence~\cite{kahl_2004}. This work forms the basis for our \lambdaPMC\
language and the two semantics. The principle difference is that
we do not consider the ``empty expression'' corresponding
to a pattern matching failure $\lambda\matchfail$;
there is simply no reduction in such cases.

Klop et.\@ al.\@~\cite{KLOP200816} re-visit the lambda calculus with
patterns from a the point of view of combinatory reduction systems
(CRSs).
