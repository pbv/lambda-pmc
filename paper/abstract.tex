  This paper presents the derivation of an abstract machine for
  \lambdaPMC, a small lazy functional language based on the pattern
  matching calculus of Kahl.  Classical presentations of pattern
  matching in abstract machines for functional languages define the
  operational semantics for a source language like Haskell
  by translation into simple case expressions.
  The translation is non-local, i.e.\@ some optimizations may be
  necessary to avoid duplicating work.
  By contrast, the translation of a language such as Haskell into
  \lambdaPMC\ is much more straightforward, preserving a
  one-to-one relation with the source language. 
  %Our objective is to provide an operational model for lazy functional
  %programs where pattern matching can be directly related to the source
  %code as written by the programmer.

  We define the syntax and two semantics for \lambdaPMC: a big-step
  natural semantics in the style of Lauchbury and a small-step
  abstract machine semantics in the style of the lazy Krivine
  machine. Finally, we prove the correspondence between the two
  semantics and present some examples from a prototype implementation.
