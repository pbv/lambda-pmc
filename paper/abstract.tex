  This paper presents the derivation of an abstract machine for
  \lambdaPMC, a small lazy functional language based on the pattern
  matching calculus of Kahl.  Classical presentations of pattern
  matching in functional languages define the operational semantics by
  translation into case expressions with simple patterns.  The
  translation is non-local and some optimizations may be necessary
  to avoid duplicating expressions.  By contrast, the translation of a
  language such as Haskell into \lambdaPMC\ is much more
  straightforward, preserving a one-to-one relation with the source
  language.
  %Our objective is to provide an operational model for lazy functional
  %programs where pattern matching can be directly related to the source
  %code as written by the programmer.

  We define the syntax and two semantics for \lambdaPMC: a big-step
  natural semantics in the style of Launchbury and a small-step
  abstract machine semantics in the style of the lazy Krivine
  machine. Finally, we prove the correspondence between the two
  semantics and present some examples from a prototype implementation.
