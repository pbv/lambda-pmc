% Example 1 : isShort (foo True)
%
% foo x = [x]
%
% This illustrates pattern matching failure and sharing of evaluation


% Example 2 : zipWith f xs (tail xs)

% xs = []
% f x y = Pair(x,y)

% This illustrates that zipWith is non-strict on the second argument


% Example 3 : nodups [1,1,2,1]

% Add primitive values for integers and monomorphic == :: Int -> Int -> Bool

% Illustrates pattern guards and as patterns
